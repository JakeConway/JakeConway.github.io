Welcome!

## Prerequisites
The tutorials presented here assume that you have R and/or python installed, and that you have a basic understanding of the programming syntax of each language (e.g. variables, functions, classes). For most of the bioinformatics and computational biology tutorials, the statistics and theory behind the methods are disucessed in the Overview section. While it is not neccessary to learn or understand the statistics behind each method in order to run the tutorials **I highly recommend taking the time to do so**.
