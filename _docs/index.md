Welcome! A big motivation for me creating this website was to share some of the knowledge that has helped me tremendously in the completion of my Ph.D. I consider a lot of the analyses and skills discussed in these tutorials essential for a career in computational cancer genomics and data science. I take exceptional pride and joy in mentoring..... Some of my favorite experiences during my Ph.D. occured through taking on mentorship roles, and some even led to publications!

## Tutorial/Mentoring Style

## Prerequisites
The tutorials presented here assume that you have R and/or python installed, and that you have a basic understand of the programming syntax of each language (e.g. variables, functions, classes). For most of the bioinformatics and computational biology tutorials, the statistics and theory behind the methods are disucessed in the Overview section. While it is not neccessary to learn or understand the statistics behind each method in order to run the tutorials **I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TAKING THE TIME TO DO SO**.
