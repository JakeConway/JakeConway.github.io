              <p class="lead">I'm a PhD candidate in the 
                <a href="http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/BIG/">Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) program</a> 
                at Harvard Medical School, and a member of the <a href="https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/">Van Allen lab</a> 
                at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and The Broad Institute. My research focuses on melanoma genomics and transcriptomics, 
                genomic correlates of immunotherapy response, and tumor clonal architecture and evolution. My research is supported by a 
                <a href="https://www.grantome.com/grant/NIH/F31-CA239347-01"> National Insitute of Health (NIH) F31 award </a>
                through the National Cancer Institute (NCI). </p>
                <p class="lead"> My intentions for creating this site are twofold: (1) to serve as an online CV, and (2) to provide 
                {% if page.sectionid=='docs' %} class="active" {% endif %}<a href="{{ "/docs/home/" | relative_url }}">documentation, resources, and hands-on examples</a> on how to run a variety of bioinformatic and statistical tools commonly used in cancer genomics, perform fundamental statical analyses, and develop a variety of machine learning models including neural networks. I've been extremely fortunate to be part of the Van Allen Lab community, and have enjoyed mentoring an increasing number of graduate students, medical students, and clinical fellows. My personal mentoring philosophy is to compress years worth of knowledge and experience into hands-on tutorials (with explainations!), and I hope that this site will help future generations of cancer researchers take their science to new heights.
