              <p class="lead">I received my PhD in 
                <a href="http://bigphd.hms.harvard.edu/">Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG)</a> from Harvard University, where I was a member of the  <a href="https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/">Van Allen lab</a> 
                at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Broad Institute. My research focused on melanoma genomics and transcriptomics, 
                genomic correlates of immunotherapy response, DNA repair mechanisms such as HRD and MSI, and tumor clonal architecture and evolution. My research was supported by a National Insitute of Health
                <a href="https://www.grantome.com/grant/NIH/F31-CA239347-01"> F31 award </a>
                through the National Cancer Institute. My current position is a Senior Biomedical Data Scientist at <a href="http://www.pathai.com/">PathAI</a> where I develop and apply novel deep learning based approaches to pathology images to understand their clinical and molecular underpinnings.</p>
                <p class="lead">My intentions for creating this site are twofold: (1) to serve as an online CV, and (2) to provide 
                {% if page.sectionid=='docs' %} class="active" {% endif %}<a href="{{ "/docs/home/" | relative_url }}">documentation, resources, and hands-on examples</a> on how to run a variety of computational biology methods commonly used in cancer genomics, perform fundamental statical analyses, and develop a variety of machine learning models including neural networks. My personal mentoring philosophy is to compress years worth of knowledge and experience into hands-on tutorials, and I hope that this site will help future generations of researchers more easily add to their computational skillsets.
